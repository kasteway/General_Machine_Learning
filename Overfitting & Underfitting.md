# Overfitting (High Variance) & Underfitting (High Bias):

Generalization refers to a model's ability to apply what it has learned from the training data to new, unseen data, effectively balancing between overfitting and underfitting to make accurate predictions. Overfitting occurs when a model is excessively complex, fitting the training data too closely, including its noise and outliers, leading to poor performance on new, unseen data. Underfitting happens when a model is too simplistic, failing to capture the underlying patterns in the data, and thus performs poorly on both training and new data.


#### Overfitting (High Variance):

- Complex Model: Occurs when the model is too complex relative to the amount and noise of the training data.

- High Variance: The model has high variance and captures random noise in the data, not just the actual trend.

- Performs Too Well on Training Data: It performs exceptionally well on training data but poorly on unseen data (test data).

- Lack of Generalization: The model fails to generalize from the training data to new data.

- Causes: Often caused by having too many parameters, too little data, or not using techniques to prevent overfitting (like regularization).

##### Solving Overfitting:

- Increase Training Data: More data can help the model generalize better.

- Reduce Model Complexity: Simplify the model by reducing the number of layers or parameters in neural networks.

- Regularization Techniques: Apply techniques like L1 or L2 regularization to penalize complex models.

- Cross-Validation: Use cross-validation techniques to ensure the model performs well on unseen data.

- Feature Selection: Reduce the number of input features to eliminate irrelevant data.

- Early Stopping: Stop training when the model's performance on a validation set starts to decline.

- Dropout (for Neural Networks): Randomly omit units from the neural network during training to prevent co-adaptation of features.

#### Underfitting (High Bias):

- Simple Model: Occurs when the model is too simple to capture the underlying pattern in the data.

- High Bias: The model has high bias and oversimplifies the problem, leading to errors in both training and test data.

- Poor Performance Overall: It performs poorly even on training data.

- Lack of Complexity: The model fails to capture important aspects of the dataâ€™s structure.

- Causes: Often caused by having too few parameters, ignoring important features, or overly simplifying the model.


##### Solving Underfitting:

- Increase Model Complexity: Use a more complex model with more parameters or layers.

- Feature Engineering: Create more relevant features from the existing data.

- Reduce Regularization: If regularization is too strong, it might lead to underfitting. Reducing it can help.

- Increase Training Time: Allow the model more time or more epochs to learn from the data.

- Use Better Represented Data: Ensure that the training data contains all the variability of the real-world data.

- Hyperparameter Tuning: Experiment with different settings for the model's hyperparameters to find a better fit.

- Ensemble Methods: Combine the predictions of multiple models to improve overall performance.
