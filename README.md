## Feature Scaling:

1. Mean Normalization (Standard Scaler) 
- Feature scaling through mean normalization involves adjusting the values of numeric features in your data to have a mean of zero. This is done to bring different features onto a similar scale, which can be beneficial in many machine learning algorithms, including linear regression.
- Mean normalization helps in improving the performance and training stability of many machine learning models by ensuring that all features contribute equally to the prediction and that gradients are not disproportionately influenced by certain features during training.

#### The process of mean normalization typically involves two steps for each feature::
- Subtract the Mean: For each value in a feature, subtract the mean of that feature from the value. This shifts the distribution of each feature to be centered around zero.
- Divide by Range or Standard Deviation: After subtracting the mean, you often divide each value by the range (difference between the maximum and minimum values) or the standard deviation of that feature. This step scales the feature values so that they fall within a similar range.

#### Key points about Mean Normalization:
- Scaling: Unlike standardization, which scales data to have a unit variance, mean normalization scales data so that it falls within a range that is centered around zero. This can be particularly helpful when you want to ensure your model is not biased towards variables on a larger scale.
- Improves Convergence in Gradient Descent: For algorithms that use gradient descent, mean normalization can help in faster convergence because it ensures that all the features have similar scales, thereby optimizing the path to the minimum.
- Less Sensitive to Outliers than MinMax Scaling: While still affected by outliers, mean normalization is generally less sensitive to them compared to MinMax scaling since it uses the mean and the range of values.
- Use in Machine Learning: It's commonly used in machine learning preprocessing, especially when algorithms assume features to be centered around zero.
- Impact on Interpretation: The transformation changes the interpretation of the data, as it no longer represents the original units. This is important to consider in exploratory data analysis and when interpreting model coefficients.
- No Fixed Range: Unlike MinMax scaling, mean normalization does not scale data to a fixed range like [0, 1]. The range after mean normalization depends on the original distribution of the feature.

2. MinMax Feature Scaling:

- MinMax scaling is a type of feature scaling that rescales the range of features to scale the range in [0, 1] or [a, b]. This is achieved by subtracting the minimum value of the feature and then dividing by the range of the feature.

#### Key points about MinMax scaling:

- Normalizes the Scale: Brings all features to the same scale [0, 1] or any other specified range.
- Preservation of Relationships: Maintains the relationships among the original data values since it is a linear transformation.
- Sensitive to Outliers: Since it uses the min and max values, outliers can significantly affect the scaling.
- Usage in Machine Learning: Often used in machine learning algorithms that do not assume any specific distribution of the data, like neural networks, and those that are sensitive to the scale of the input, like k-nearest neighbors.
